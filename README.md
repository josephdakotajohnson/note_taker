## Features

 - When the user types input into either the 'Note Title' or the 'Note Text' area, a button pops up that allows them to clear their form.
 - When the user types input into both the 'Note Title' and the 'Note Text' areas, a button pops up that allows them to add their form to the notes.
 - Then the user can click the note to view their previous form.
 - Then the user can click the 'trash can' icon on their previously made form to permanently delete the form from their notes.
 - If the user types "Easter Egg" into the 'Note Title' section of the form and "This is the Easter Egg!" into the 'Note Text' of the form, then saves it, the user will have this project's Easter Egg.
